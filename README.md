# SilicicCumulates_GeochemistryToPhysicalParameters

Data files and Matlab script to implement mass balance calculation aimed at quantifying the residual melt fraction (Fg), fraction of melt extracted (fme) and porosity (Ï†), of a silicic cumulate in 1D and 2D. Conceptualization of the model in Tavazzani et al. (submitted).

## Usage

The script 'BulkGeochem_to_2D_1D_params.m' is annotated for easy use, the user needs to independently download the surface fitting function gridfit.m (Copyright (c) 2016, John D'Errico) from MathWorks at: https://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8998-surface-fitting-using-gridfit.
